# Minimal Browser
A browser that lets you... well... browse the internet. Nothing else. We've had enough with Google's and othe companies bs.

# Features
- No tracking
- Multiple tabs (double click on the tab bar to open new tab)
- Default **DuckDuckGo** search engine
- Navigate forward and backwards
- Zoom (Ctrl + scroll)
- Low memory

 # Problems
 - Since this is browser like in the good old day, it might not support some JavaScript and CSS features.
 - YouTube is quite unuseable, so this isn't for watching content.

# Requirements
*If you want to build on top of it*
```py
pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
```
